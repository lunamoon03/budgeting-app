# CLI Budgeting
This is a CLI program for keeping track of your money :). Maybe one day I can make it into a full GUI program...

# Running the program
`cd` into the dir and run `cargo run -- [path/to/file.csv]`.
By default, the program reads the path from the directory you're in. You can save the file in other places with paths like `../[path]` or `~/[path]`.
If a file does not exist in the path location, a file will be made.

# Issues
Open issues for bugs or feature requests? Although I have a job and school so don't expect anything soon haha.
